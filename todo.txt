think of a way to handle magic E?

clean up the words and put in a separate json file 

create ai images for all of the words 

separate words by easy, medium, hard, etc

figure out how to create login, save state, track progress / scores, etc

maybe make parts work offline 

stats for parents -- which words they get right / wrong, etc

algorithm for spaced repetition, when you get words right, show less often, but still show on occasion
